<p>Anxiety tips and advice</p>
<p>What do you do when you are stressed? There are times that we get anxious and we worry because of different things. From my personal experience when I feel anxious, I rest (includes things I want to do like watching a drama, eating, or sleeping) first to clear my mind. I believe that when our minds are at ease, it's easier to be productive. I really hope you rest too ^^ </p>
