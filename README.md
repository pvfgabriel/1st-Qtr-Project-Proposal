Title: Students' Mental Health Appreciation

Description: Our mental health really matters, especially since the pandemic hit. We were stuck at home and needed to adjust to different online set-ups for the past 2 years. There were so-called online classes or the new mode of learning that stressed the most of us, including me. Learning, understanding, and passing before the deadline seemed dificult that students' mental health were already being affected. Too much stress can cause anxiety and depression, which is bad for a person who is growing and studying, a.k.a the students. As someone who also experienced anxiety because of my studies, I know how you feel, and to help you feel better, read and explore more this website. Hope I can help!:D 

Homepage: This contains the title, description, and links that lead to the other web pages. Also has an encouraging image, some designs, and a good layout.

2nd Webpage: The 2nd web page contains a talking session with my reader in writing style but they'll just answer through their minds, tips and advice about anxiety, sharing about healthy living and being productive, and some brain exercises involving self-reflection and meditation/relaxation. There will also be images, design, and layout.
