<p>"Your mental health matters", always remember that. We were stuck at home and needed to adjust to the online set-up for the past 2 years. There were so-called online classes or the new mode of learning that stressed many of us, including me. Too much stress can cause anxiety and depression, which is bad for a person who is growing and studying, a.k.a the students. As someone who also experienced anxiety because of my studies, I know how you feel. To help you feel better, read and explore more this website to see experiences, thoughts, and advice regarding mental health :D
